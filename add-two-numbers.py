# Add two numbers		# starting with # in Python programming is a comment.

num1 = 3				# num1 is a variable. You can store a value in a variable. Here, 3 is stored in this variable.
num2 = 4				# num2 is a variable. You can store a value in a variable. Here, 4 is stored in this variable.

sum = num1 + num2		# The variables num1 and num2 are added using + operator. The result of addition is then stored in another variable sum

print(sum)				# The print() function prints the output to the screen.
